# pgf-cmykshadings â€” Support for CMYK shadings in PGF/TikZ

The `pgf-cmykshadings` package provides support for CMYK shadings in PGF/TikZ.

At present functional shadings are not supported.

It will only work with `pdflatex`, `lualatex`, and `xelatex`.

## Usage

Just add `\usepackage{pgf-cmykshadings}` to your document preamble.

### Colour models

By default, `pgf-cmykshadings` will always produce CMYK shadings unless the
current `xcolor` colour model is RGB, in which case an RGB shading will be
produced. This is equivalent to using the `cmyk` package option.

The package option `rgb` will always produce `rgb` shadings unless the current
`xcolor` colour model is CMYK, in which case a CMYK shading will be produced.

In practice this means that if you are using the natural colour model of `xcolor` you can still get mismatched colours if you, for example, create a shading from green (which is defined as RGB) to cyan (which is defined as CMYK). The shading has to pick one colour model and will look different to one of the solid colours.

It is recommended to always load `xcolor` before before `pgf-cmykshadings` with
either the `rgb` or `cmyk` option to avoid colour surprises.

### Load order

- `pgf-cmykshadings` should be loaded *before* any shadings are defined
  otherwise these will be defined as RGB. This means you should load
  `pgf-cmykshadings` before (for example) `tikz` and `beamer`.
- If you want to pass custom options to `xcolor` (e.g., a colour model or set
  of named colours), you should load `pgf-cmykshadings` *after* `xcolor` or use
  `\PassOptionsToPackage{...}{xcolor}` before loading `pgf-cmykshadings`.

### Explicitly choosing RGB or CMYK shadings

RGB shadings can always be set up using:

  - `\pgfdeclarehorizontalrgbshading`
  - `\pgfdeclareverticalrgbshading`
  - `\pgfdeclareradialrgbshading`

And then used with `\pgfusergbshading`.

Similarly, CMYK shadings can always be set up using:

  - `\pgfdeclarehorizontalcmykshading`
  - `\pgfdeclareverticalcmykshading`
  - `\pgfdeclareradialcmykshading`

And then used with `\pgfusecmykshading`.
