# pgf-cmykshadings â€” Support for CMYK and grayscale shadings in PGF/TikZ

The `pgf-cmykshadings` package provides support for CMYK and grayscale shadings
for the `pgf` package. By default `pgf` only supports RGB shadings. Horizontal,
vertical, radial, and functional shadings are supported for pdfLaTeX, LuaLaTeX,
and XeLaTeX. `pgf-cmykshadings` attempts to produce shadings consistent with
the currently selected `xcolor` colour model. The `rgb`, `cmyk`, and `gray`
colour models from the `xcolor` package are supported.

## Installation from TeXLive or MiKTeX

`pgf-cmykshadings` is in TeXLive and MiKTeX and can be installed in the usual

`pgfsys-cmykshadings-xetex.def`, `pgfsys-cmykshadings-luatex.def`, and
`pgfsys-cmykshadings-dvipdfmx.def`.

Copy these generated files to `$TEXMFHOME/tex/latex/pgf-cmykshadings/` and
`pgf-cmykshadings.pdf` to `$TEXMFHOME/doc/latex/pgf-cmykshadings/`.

You can find `$TEXMFHOME` by running:
