# pgf-cmykshadings â€” Support for CMYK shadings in PGF/TikZ

The `pgf-cmykshadings` package provides support for CMYK shadings in PGF/TikZ.

At present functional shadings are not supported.

It will only work with `pdflatex`, `lualatex`, and `xelatex`.

## Usage

Just add `\usepackage{pgf-cmykshadings}` to your document preamble. CMYK
shadings are used by default.

RGB shadings can continue to be used by using the following macros:

  - `\pgfdeclarehorizontalrgbshading`
  - `\pgfdeclareverticalrgbshading`
  - `\pgfdeclareradialrgbshading`

An RGB shading can then be used with `\pgfusergbshading`.

It is also possible to retain RGB shadings as the default and use CMYK shadings
on demand. This can be set up by loading `pgf-cmykshadings` with the
`nodefault` option. In this case, CMYK shadings can be set up using the
following macros:

  - `\pgfdeclarehorizontalcmykshading`
  - `\pgfdeclareverticalcmykshading`
  - `\pgfdeclareradialcmykshading`

And a CMYK shading can then be used with `\pgfusecmykshading`.
